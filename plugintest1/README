What is it ?
============

This software is a plugin for Xcode, adding native support for the Fortran langage in Xcode.
You need to install the gcc fortran compiler independantly.

It supports :
- source code highlighting (.f77 or .f95 files)
- Xcode look & feel to manage a project
- writing pure Fortran programs
- mixing Fortran with other languages like C
- debug fortran code from Xcode

How to install ?
================

Copy "Fortran.pbplugin" to "~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/"
Copy "File Templates/*" to "~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/File Templates/Fortran/"

Tested with Xcode 3.0 only. Won't work with previous versions.

By default, the plugin look for a gcc fortan-enabled compiler at /usr/local/bin.
If the compiler is installed at a different location (like /usr/local/gfortran-4.2/bin),
let the plugin know it by running the following command in a shell :
defaults com.apple.Xcode DBGFortranBasePath /usr/local/gfortran-4.2

How to use ?
============

Just add your fortran files to an existing project using the ld linker (it is the case for
most C project).
